Source: http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/PrintRecipe?RID=1330&radio=3

Ingredients:

- 680g lukewarm water
- 907g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour*
- 14g salt
- 14g instant or active dry yeast

Directions:

1. *The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe. If you measure flour by
prinkling it into your measuring cup, then gently sweeping off the excess,use 7 1/2 cups. If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister,then sweeping off the excess, use 6 1/2 cups. Most accurate of all, andguaranteed to give you the best results, if you measure flour by weight, use32 ounces.
2. Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart),food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, "lukewarm" means about 105°F, butdon't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm isfine; "OUCH, that's hot!" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.
3. Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If youhave a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60seconds. If you don't have a mixer, just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or doughwhisk until everything is combined.
4. Next, you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plasticbucket, you're all set — just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid orplastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. If you've made thedough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl;it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can ifyou like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bakebread.
5. Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (Ifyou're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you chillit for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so,it'll rise, then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.
6. When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour;this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about1/4 to 1/3 of the dough — a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece, if you have a scale.It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit. 
7. Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or alonger log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can. 
8. Place the loaf on a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone);or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating offlour over the top; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking. 
9. Let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise; this should take about 60 minutes (or longer, up to a couple of hours, if your house is cool). It won'tappear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand.Preheat your oven to 450°F while the loaf rests. If you're using a baking stone,position it on a middle rack while the oven preheats. Place a shallow metal orcast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1cup of hot water ready to go.
10. When you're ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times,making a cut about 1/2" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's OK, it'll pickright up in the hot oven.
11. Place the bread in the oven — onto the baking stone, if you're using one, or simply onto a middle rack, if it's on a pan — and carefully pour the 1 cup hotwater into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close theoven door quickly.
12. Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown. 
13. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread ina plastic bag at room temperature.
